# Project Auth API

The task was to create a login using MongoDB, Node and Express and connect to the frontend using Redux. I also needed to create proper error message that you be displayed for the frontend dev but also the user. 

## The problem

I started by coding along during the live session with Daniel. I started by creating the backend endpoints and the schemas for the user as well as the messages. I used the terms message as well as thought which I realize now can be a little confusing. I took some time do figure out what happened in the backend and how to use the access token. I wanted to only display 20 messages so re-used some code from the previous happy thoughts project. One thing that I'm proud of is how error messages are displayed for the user in the login component. I realized that all error messages have the same structure and they can be accessed the same way as the data we're getting back if we get a successful response.
